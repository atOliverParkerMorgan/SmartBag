## What can it do?
The apps main function is to calculate the texbooks & workbooks that you have to put in and take out of your bag in order for it to be ready. The items are sorted into these categories:
* Put into your bag
* Take out of your bag
* In your bag

The following is also included:
* A Timetable containing all of your subjects
* The option to synch your app with Bakaláři to get a up to date timetable
* The option to set for what day you need to prepare for
* You can also exclude or include Saturday & Sunday
* You can store you're timetable in the cloud and share it with your classmates
* Remove, Edit or Add any Subject or it's items

## Current state
Everything is done except the bakalář implementation.
